# IT Dad

## Overview

IT Dad is my personal website where I document my work, projects, and life.

This site has seen a lot of change over the years. Sadly, this change is not in the form of content, but in design and architecture. Originally this started out as Ghost Blog deployed on a Digital Ocean droplet, but then I learned about JAMStack and that I could host my site for free and make it globablly distributed at the same time through the use of CDNs. So I migrated everything to Hugo and deployed my site using Netlify. I was never satisfied with Hugo and now I am migrating everything once again to Next.js and deploying through Vercel.

This Next.js site is based on the [Tailwind/Nextjs Starter blog][1] as well as the work from [Tuan Anh (Leo) Huynh][2]
